so maybe the thought for taking form data

Open a file,
read the array/hash
take new array/ hash and save it
out put the hash just for shits  and giggles to verfiy anything is done
print loop
search


in another method just open file read and out put it to see that it is infact there.



for state, abbrev in states
    puts "%s state is abbreviated %s and has city %s" % [
        state, abbrev, cities[abbrev]]
end
